# Powerful Command-Line Applications in OCaml

OCaml implementations of the CLI tools built in the book [Powerful Command-Line
Applications in
Go](https://pragprog.com/titles/rggo/powerful-command-line-applications-in-go/).

As I work through that book, after finishing each chapter in Go following the book, I'm
implementing the same tool in OCaml. For this, I'm mainly focusing on the _requirements_
(as I understand them) rather than on the original design given by the book. My goals
with this:

- Getting better at OCaml, both the language as well as its ecosystem.
- Get a feel for how OCaml compares to Go for creating CLI applications, knowing that Go
  is a popular language for doing so.
- Practicing TDD and decoupling techniques.
